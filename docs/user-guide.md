This guide is aimed for KERO final users and provides information on how to access and use the different services provided.

### Login in and accessing a desktop

To login to your desktop, follow these steps:

### How to use personal and shared storage

* Your **personal storage** is located under _/home/users/`<your-VNC-username>`/_ 
* The **shared storage** is located under _/mnt/shared/_

Feel free to save your personal data on your **personal storage**, and communal data on **shared storage**.

Every other directory is ephemeral storage. This means that data saved outside personal or shared storage will not be persisted on desktop reboot.
